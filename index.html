        <p>On the World: Formations of the Self is a short five part poetry series that functions as an exploration and reflection on life and the self - particularly the self as a part of the wider scope of all life, musing on how individuals shape and are shaped by our environments, and how that affects our shared future.</p>

    <h1 class="headings">artist statement</h1>
    <div class="text-hold">
        <p>On the World was written with a semi-free verse poetry style and was informed in visual style by posters of the Art Nouveau period within design. Abstraction is also utilized for the style of the work. These elements connect to the esoteric and exploratory nature of the work, and concepts touched upon within such as the path of life and nature - free verse and abstraction in that there is not set confinements to its structure, and the Art Nouveau's embracing of natural motifs, which make a bit of appearance within the work.</p>
